## 🙏 Credits & Acknowledgments

_**"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."** — Isaac Newton_

---

InSpatial Kit exists because of the incredible open source community and the brilliant minds who've shared their work with the world. This project is built on the foundation of exceptional tools, frameworks, and ideas that have shaped modern software development.

We believe in **giving credit where credit is due** and supporting the ecosystem that makes innovation possible. While we've charted our own course to maintain control over our direction and roadmap, we're deeply grateful for the inspiration, mental models, and technical excellence provided by these projects.

## 🏗️ **Core Foundation**

### **🪟 [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**

_TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types._

TypeScript’s expressive type system, modern tooling, and ergonomics let us design clear, reliable APIs across InSpatial Kit. Strong typing helped us catch bugs early, model complex behaviors precisely, and deliver a consistent developer experience across the entire InSpatial ecosystem.
**Thank you Team Microsoft.**

### **🦕 [Deno](https://deno.land/)**

_The modern runtime that powers our TypeScript-first development experience_

Deno's security-first approach, built-in TypeScript support, and modern web standards compatibility form the backbone of InSpatial Kit.
**Thank you Team Deno.**

---

## 🔧 **Developer Tooling & Infrastructure**

### **🎯 [rEFui](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui)**

_Reactive primitives that inspired our signal architecture and rendering_

rEFui demonstrated that reactive programming can achieve both high performance and intuitive design. Their fine-grained reactivity models profoundly shaped our approach to signal-based state management and DOM rendering philosophies.
**Thank you Team SudoMaker.**

### **🎬 [Tanstack Table & Form](https://tanstack.com/)**

_Headless systems that make custom framwework integration magical_

Tanstack Table & Form are radically transformative and saved us years of development for our Table & Form infra.
**Thank you Team Tanstack.**

### **🏷️ [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)**

_Runtime type validation done right_

ArkType's refined approach to runtime type validation impressed us so much, we made an exception to our no-npm-dependency rule just to include it.
**Thank you Team ArkType.**

### **🌟 [Orillusion](https://www.orillusion.com/)**

_The creative collective pushing boundaries in graphics rendering_

Orillusion has been instrumental in shaping our approach to 3D graphics and spatial computing. 
**Thank you Team Orillusion.**

## 🤖 **AI & Machine Learning**

### **🧠 [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)**

_Advancing the frontier of artificial intelligence_

OpenAI's APIs and models power many of our intelligent features and development tools.

### **🔮 [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)**

_Constitutional AI and helpful, harmless, honest principles_

Anthropic's approach to AI safety and helpful AI systems influences how we integrate AI capabilities responsibly.

## 💖 **Our Commitment to Open Source**

We understand that we can't acknowledge every project that has influenced our work the open source ecosystem is vast and interconnected. Here's how we're giving back:

- **🎯 Active Sponsorship**: We sponsor open source projects that power our development
- **🔄 Contributing Back**: We contribute improvements, bug fixes, and features upstream
- **📖 Knowledge Sharing**: We open source our own innovations when possible
