## üôè Credits & Acknowledgments

_**"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."** ‚Äî Isaac Newton_

---

InSpatial Kit exists because of the incredible open source community and the brilliant minds who've shared their work with the world. This project is built on the foundation of exceptional tools, frameworks, and ideas that have shaped modern software development.

We believe in **giving credit where credit is due** and supporting the ecosystem that makes innovation possible. While we've charted our own course to maintain control over our direction and roadmap, we're deeply grateful for the inspiration, mental models, and technical excellence provided by these projects.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Foundation**

### **ü™ü [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**

_TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types._

TypeScript‚Äôs expressive type system, modern tooling, and ergonomics let us design clear, reliable APIs across InSpatial Kit. Strong typing helped us catch bugs early, model complex behaviors precisely, and deliver a consistent developer experience across the entire InSpatial ecosystem.
**Thank you Team Microsoft.**

### **ü¶ï [Deno](https://deno.land/)**

_The modern runtime that powers our TypeScript-first development experience_

Deno's security-first approach, built-in TypeScript support, and modern web standards compatibility form the backbone of InSpatial Kit.
**Thank you Team Deno.**

---

## üîß **Developer Tooling**

### **üéØ [rEFui](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui)**

_Reactive primitives that inspired our signal architecture and rendering_

rEFui demonstrated that reactive programming can achieve both high performance and intuitive design. Their fine-grained reactivity models profoundly shaped our approach to signal-based state management and DOM rendering philosophies.
**Thank you Team SudoMaker.**

### **üé¨ [Tanstack Table](https://tanstack.com/)**

_Headless systems that make custom framwework integration magical_

Tanstack Table has been a game-changer, enabling us to build robust table infrastructure in a fraction of the time it would have otherwise taken.
**Thank you Team Tanstack.**

### **üå≥ [Headless Tree](https://github.com/lukasbach/headless-tree)**

_The definitive tree component_

Headless Tree provided a robust, framework-agnostic approach to tree data structures and UI, showing how to separate logic from presentation for maximum flexibility.

**Thank you Lukas Bach.**

## üíñ **Our Commitment to Open Source**

We understand that we can't acknowledge every project that has influenced our work the open source ecosystem is vast and interconnected. Here's how we're giving back:

- **üéØ Active Sponsorship**: We sponsor open source projects that power our development
- **üîÑ Contributing Back**: We contribute improvements, bug fixes, and features upstream
- **üìñ Knowledge Sharing**: We open source our own innovations when possible
